# kpuputti-pack

[Emacs Live](http://overtone.github.io/emacs-live/)
([documentation](http://overtone.github.io/emacs-live/documentation.html))
pack for my [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) config.

## Requirements

Command line tools for [Flycheck](http://flycheck.github.io/):

```
npm install -g jshint csslint jsonlint coffeelint
gem install sass # or compass
pip install flake8
```

## Updating packages

From [MELPA docs](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#installing):

    package.el now includes a mechanism to upgrade packages. After
    running package-list-packages, type U (mark Upgradable packages)
    and then x (eXecute the installs and deletions). When itâ€™s done
    installing all the packages it will ask if you want to delete the
    obsolete packages and so you can hit y (Yes).

    If you run into a problem installing or upgrading, you may need to
    go into your ~/.emacs.d/elpa/ directory and delete packages that
    are installed multiple times. This can happen when the install
    times out.

## TODO

### Must

- redo without emacs live?
- intergate tern.js

- js2-mode:
  - return indents
  - sane indentation toggling
