# kpuputti's dot emacs

Built on top of
[Emacs Starter Kit](https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit),
heavily inspired by @akheron's
[dotemacs](https://github.com/akheron/dotemacs).

## Requirements

Command line tools for flycheck:

    sudo npm install -g jshint csslint jsonlint coffeelint
    sudo gem install sass # or compass
    sudo pip install flake8

## Updating packages

From [MELPA docs](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#installing):

    package.el now includes a mechanism to upgrade packages. After
    running package-list-packages, type U (mark Upgradable packages)
    and then x (eXecute the installs and deletions). When itâ€™s done
    installing all the packages it will ask if you want to delete the
    obsolete packages and so you can hit y (Yes).

    If you run into a problem installing or upgrading, you may need to
    go into your ~/.emacs.d/elpa/ directory and delete packages that
    are installed multiple times. This can happen when the install
    times out.
